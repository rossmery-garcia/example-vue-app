# Example Vue App

## Getting started
Node version 16.14.0 was used

```bash
nvm install 16.14.0
```
```bash
nvm use 16.14.0
```

The first time, you will need to run
```bash
yarn install
```
This command must also be executed for the backend server
```bash
cd api-server
yarn install
```
Then start both servers
```bash
# Front-end server
yarn dev
```
```bash
#Back-end server
yarn serve
```
